 * reset target when {@link resetAllStores} is invoked. Call this immediately after
 * creating the singleton, before any user interaction mutates the store.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The snapshot is captured **by reference**, not as a deep clone. This is safe only
 * as long as every store action replaces nested objects rather than mutating them in
 * place. Mutating in place silently corrupts the snapshot:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // SAFE — produces a new object, snapshot is unaffected
 * set({ locationInfo: newValue })
 *
 * // UNSAFE — mutates the same object the snapshot points to
 * set(s => { s.locationInfo.name = x; return s; })
 * ```
 *
 * `immer` is intentionally not used in any store to prevent accidental in-place mutation.
 *
 * @param store - The singleton store to register. Must be a module-level instance,
 * never a factory instance created for testing.
 *
 * @example
 * export const useAppStore = createAppStore();
 * registerStore(useAppStore); // call before any set() reaches the store
