description: Implement a GitHub feature issue end-to-end. Judges the issue — grills the user only if something genuinely needs clarifying (folding answers back into the issue body) — announces its reading, then launches the implement-issue-pipeline workflow (explore → build → wire PR → review → device QA → bounded auto-fix → run metrics). Explicitly invoked with an issue number, e.g. `/implement-issue 378 [--skip-explore] [--skip-review] [--skip-qa] [--worktree] [--max-fix N]`.

# implement-issue — judge, clarify if needed, then delegate to the pipeline

You (the main thread) own only the **conversation**: judging the issue, grilling when
genuinely needed, announcing your reading, and relaying the result. The entire build
pipeline lives in ONE place — the `implement-issue-pipeline` workflow — and you must
NEVER re-implement any of its stages (explore/build/review/QA/fix) here or dispatch
those agents yourself. Your job ends where the workflow begins.

**Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:**
- First token = the **issue number** (required). If missing, ask which issue to work on.
- Flags are **overrides only** — canonical defaults live in the workflow (explore, review,
  QA all ON; worktree OFF). Map each flag the user passed to a workflow arg, and pass
  NOTHING for flags they didn't:
  - `--skip-explore` → `explore: false`
  - `--skip-review` → `review: false`
  - `--skip-qa` → `qa: false`
  - `--worktree` → `worktree: true` (isolation; expect a cold install/build in the worktree)
  - `--max-fix N` → `maxFix: N`

## Stage 0 — Setup
- `gh issue view <issue>`; confirm it is a Feature-template issue (has `### Description` and
  `### Acceptance criteria`). If not, tell the user and ask how to proceed.

## Stage 1 — Judge (the only routing decision)
Read the Description + Acceptance criteria critically through **two independent lenses**.
Both are selective: raise something only when it has real teeth, and stay silent otherwise —
signal is only signal when it is scarce.

- **Lens 1 — Disambiguation ("is this clear enough to build?"):** look for genuine
  ambiguities, gaps, contradictions, or risky assumptions that would change what gets built.
- **Lens 2 — Challenge ("set aside clarity — is this a good idea?"):** an issue can be
  perfectly crisp and still be the wrong thing to build. Look for a hidden risk the issue
  ignores, or a materially cheaper/better alternative that achieves the same goal. This is
  the merit of the work, not its clarity — do NOT infer doubts from your own preferences,
  and do NOT manufacture a critique to look diligent. Most sound issues clear this lens in
  silence.

Route on the combined result:

- **If both lenses come up empty (clear AND sound):** say so and move on — do NOT manufacture
  questions or objections, and do NOT wait for approval. PR review is the approval gate for
  crisp issues.
- **If either lens surfaces something with real teeth:** run the `grilling` skill — interview
  the user one question at a time until both the ambiguity is resolved AND any substantive
  challenge is either addressed or consciously accepted by the user. When a question can be
  answered by reading the codebase, explore instead of asking. Stay focused on what affects
  the implementation and the acceptance criteria; a challenge the user overrules is settled —
  record their decision and proceed, don't relitigate.

**Fold clarifications back into the issue body** (only if grilling happened):
- Rewrite the issue so it is the single improved source of truth: update `### Description`
  and `### Acceptance criteria` (and `### Out of scope` if scope changed) to incorporate
  every resolved clarification. Keep the **exact** Feature-template headings. Do not pad or
  invent scope — reflect only what the user actually confirmed.
- Show the user the rewritten body and get their explicit go-ahead, then apply it with
  `gh issue edit <issue> --body-file <file>` (editing the issue is an outward action).
- **Fallback** — if the user declines the body edit: post the clarifications as an issue
  comment instead (`gh issue comment <issue> --body-file <file>`) and pass them to the
  workflow via the `clarifications` arg.

## Stage 2 — Announce, don't ask
- **If you grilled:** the synthesis at the end of the grilling conversation ("so I'll build
  X, Y, Z") already served as the announcement — proceed directly to Stage 3.
- **If you did not grill (issue was clear and sound):** state your reading in ONE short message — the acceptance
  criteria as you understand them, the feature/area you expect it to touch, and any flags
  in effect — then IMMEDIATELY proceed to Stage 3 without waiting for a reply. The user
  interrupts if the reading is wrong; silence is consent.

## Stage 3 — Delegate to the pipeline
- Invoke the **Workflow tool** with `{ name: "implement-issue-pipeline", args: { issue: <n>,
  startedAt: <unix epoch>, ...overrides } }` — `startedAt` is the output of `date +%s` at
  invocation time (the pipeline uses it to compute wall-clock durations; workflow scripts
  cannot read the clock). Include `clarifications` only in the fallback case above. This
  skill explicitly authorizes that Workflow call.
- The workflow runs explore → build → wire PR → review ∥ device QA → finding vetting →
  bounded auto-fix (history-aware, convergence-checked) → ONE consolidated run-report
  comment (posted even on an aborted run), and returns `{ prUrl, explored, reviewVerdict,
  qaVerdict, qaItems, fixAttempts, stuck, passed, outstanding, suspects, refuted }`.
- While it runs, do not poll or narrate; report when it completes.

## Stage 4 — Report
- Relay the result: the PR URL, review verdict, QA verdict (with per-criterion `qaItems`
  coverage), fix attempts, and anything needing the user's attention:
  - `outstanding` — confirmed findings left after the fix loop (human intervention). If
    `stuck` is true, the loop stopped early because a fix round made no progress — say so
    explicitly; the same findings came back and repeating the fix would have been a reroll.
  - `suspects` — device claims the vetter could not verify from code + evidence; these are
    never auto-fixed and ALWAYS need human eyes (they block a clean `passed`).
  - `refuted` — findings the vetter dismissed (mention them so the human can spot-check).
  - Non-blocking notes: QA items `BLOCKED`/`NEEDS-REVIEW`, or QA `NOT_PERFORMED`.
- Offer the natural follow-up: once the AI review bots have commented on the fresh PR,
  `/triage-pr <pr>` drives their threads to zero before the user's human review pass.
- Do not merge the PR.

## Notes
- **Headless/batch entry:** for unattended runs (queue draining, overnight), invoke the
  `implement-issue-pipeline` workflow directly — same pipeline, no conversation. This skill
  is the human-present front door.
- **One encoding rule:** any change to pipeline behavior (stages, defaults, prompts, caps)
  belongs in `.claude/workflows/implement-issue-pipeline.js` — never here.
- This skill is long-running once delegated; the QA stage drives the simulator and takes
  the most time.
