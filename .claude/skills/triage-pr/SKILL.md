description: Iteratively triage AI review-bot comments on an open pull request until the bots go quiet or a tripwire hands the loop back — vet each finding with finding-vetter, auto-fix confirmed ones, resolve noise with short replies, and consult the user in chat for judgment calls. Explicitly invoked with a PR number, e.g. `/triage-pr 402 [--issue N] [--max-rounds N]`. No reports — thread replies plus a short closing message only.

# triage-pr — the bot-review triage loop

You (the main thread) run an iterative triage loop over AI review-bot comments on an open
PR. You are the loop precisely because it contains human gates: judgment calls are settled
in conversation with the user, mid-round. Everything mechanical is scripted or dispatched.

**Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:** first token = the **PR number** (required). `--issue N` overrides
the issue number otherwise derived from the PR head branch (`feature/<n>`) — needed for
commit messages (`type(<issue>): ...` is hook-enforced). `--max-rounds N` overrides the wave
cap (default **10**, see step 3), mirroring the pipeline's `--max-fix N`; it must be a
positive integer, otherwise tell the user and use the default.

## Ground rules
- **Bot comments only.** Author allowlist: `coderabbitai`, `sourcery-ai`, `cubic-dev-ai`.
  Human-authored threads are untouchable — never reply to, resolve,
  or act on one; if any exist, mention them to the user once and move on.
- **Reply style:** one or two plain sentences per thread, honest verdicts ("Fixed in
  `<sha>`" / "Not valid because …" / "Deferred because …"). Never use em-dashes or double
  hyphens in replies.
- **Never** force-push, edit the PR body/title, or edit existing comments.
- **No summary output anywhere** — no PR report comment, no digest. The loop ends with a
  2–3 sentence chat message: rounds run, fixes (with SHAs), resolves, anything deferred,
  "your turn to review".
- Work on the PR's head branch. If the working tree is dirty when you need to check it
  out, stop and ask the user.

## The loop

**0. Setup.** `gh pr view <pr> --json state,headRefName` — must be OPEN. Derive the issue
number from the head ref. Check out the head branch.

**1. Watch.** Fetch the current state first — if unresolved bot threads already exist,
skip straight to triage. Otherwise start a background watcher (poll every ~5 minutes):
exit when unresolved bot threads appear, or when the quiet condition holds — **no
unresolved bot threads AND no pending bot check runs (`gh pr checks <pr>`) AND one more
grace poll still quiet**. Quiet → step 4. Threads → step 2.

**2. Triage the wave.**
- Fetch unresolved threads (query below), filter to the bot allowlist.
- **Vet every finding**: dispatch one `finding-vetter` per finding (parallel dispatches in
  one message), giving it the finding text, file/line, PR URL, and branch. Its verdicts
  map directly:
  - **confirmed** → collect for fixing.
  - **refuted** → reply with the vetter's reason (short), resolve the thread.
  - **suspect / judgment call** → consult the user in chat: the finding, the vetter's
    reasoning, and 2–3 proposed options. If they decide **fix**, the finding JOINS the
    confirmed fix batch below — its commit must exist before its thread is replied to and
    resolved (never resolve a fix decision on words alone). If they decide **resolve** or
    **defer**, reply with their reason and resolve.
  - **Below-bar rule (raised in later waves):** a finding can be technically true and
    still not worth a fix here. The orchestrator may resolve it alone ONLY when it is
    OBJECTIVELY inapplicable — an edge that cannot occur in this repository, or a
    factually wrong premise (things with a checkable truth value). Anything taste- or
    threshold-shaped is a judgment call and goes to the user like any other. Never let
    technically-true-but-inapplicable findings drive endless accommodation. After wave 1,
    only clear correctness, security, reliability, or data-integrity issues earn a fix.
- **Fix the confirmed batch**: dispatch `feature-builder` in fix mode on the head branch —
  findings verbatim, no new branch or PR, and instruct it explicitly to post NO PR comment
  and return its summary in its final message only.
- **Push first, then close threads**: after the batch commits, push and CONFIRM the push
  succeeded; only then reply to each fixed thread with its commit SHA and resolve it — a
  resolved thread must never cite a SHA that is not on the PR's remote branch. Then return
  to step 1.

**3. Tripwires — the wave cap and the stuck detector.**

A **wave** is one complete pass of step 2: fetch threads → vet → fix → push. Watcher polls
in step 1 are NOT waves — waiting for the bots costs nothing, acting on them does.

**Wave cap: 10 waves**, overridable with `--max-rounds N`. This is a deliberate
**reversal** of this skill's earlier "there is deliberately no round cap" stance, recorded
here so a `docs-audit` run reads it as the current decision rather than as drift — do not
restore the uncapped wording. An unbounded loop is acceptable only while a human is
watching it start, and `/implement-issue` now starts this loop automatically. The cap lives
in this skill and applies on **every** invocation, manual included: this loop never behaves
differently depending on its caller.

**Stuck detector.**
Fingerprint each wave's bot findings as a **sorted multiset of thread identities**
(`path:line` plus normalized text, joined and sorted — same semantics as the pipeline's
`roundFingerprint`). Never a plain text set: that collapses identical findings at
different locations, so fixing one occurrence while the other legitimately persists would
fake a stuck state and stop the loop with a fixable finding still open. If a wave's
fingerprint matches any previous wave's, stop: the same findings keep returning, more
rounds are rerolls. Tell the user which findings are stuck and hand the loop over.

**Handing back.** There are exactly three stop conditions short of quiet: the wave cap is
reached, the watcher prints `WINDOW_CLOSED`, or the stuck detector fires. On any of them,
stop at step 4 and hand the loop back to the human — the reason, what is still open, and the
resume command `/triage-pr <pr>` (add `--max-rounds N` when the cap was the reason). Never
auto-restart the watcher and never keep looping until quiet on your own.

**4. Finish.** The short closing message described in the ground rules, naming the stop
reason: bots quiet, or one of the three hand-back conditions with its resume command.
Nothing else.

## Recipes

Unresolved threads (id, author, body, path, line). Resolved threads consume the page
budget too — if `hasNextPage` is true, paginate with `after: "<endCursor>"` before
trusting any count, or unresolved threads past the page can silently read as zero:
```
gh api graphql -f query='query { repository(owner: "<owner>", name: "<repo>") {
  pullRequest(number: <pr>) { reviewThreads(first: 100) { pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor } nodes {
    id isResolved path line comments(first: 1) { nodes { author { login } body } } } } } } }'
```

Reply, then resolve (two complete commands per thread):
```
gh api graphql -f query='mutation($tid: ID!, $body: String!) { addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(input: {pullRequestReviewThreadId: $tid, body: $body}) { comment { id } } }' -f tid="<thread-id>" -f body="<reply text>"
gh api graphql -f query='mutation($tid: ID!) { resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: $tid}) { thread { isResolved } } }' -f tid="<thread-id>"
```
Always double-quote `tid` and `body` — an unquoted multi-word body shell-splits before
`gh` ever sees it. For bodies with special characters, build them in a variable or a
heredoc-driven script rather than inline.

Background watcher (5-minute spacing, run_in_background) — this loop IS the quiet
condition: threads exit early; QUIET requires no threads AND no pending bot checks held
across one extra grace poll. Both API reads FAIL CLOSED on empty output: an auth or
network failure must abort the watcher, never read as "zero threads / zero pending".
(Do not fail on the exit code of `gh pr checks` — it exits 8 for pending and 1 for
failed checks; only empty output means the API was unreachable.)
```
QUIET=0
for i in $(seq 1 12); do
  N=$(<unresolved BOT thread count via the query above, paginated> 2>/dev/null)
  [ -z "$N" ] && echo "API_UNAVAILABLE: thread query returned nothing" && exit 1
  [ "$N" -gt 0 ] && echo "THREADS: $N" && exit 0
  PENDING=$(gh pr checks <pr> --json bucket --jq '[.[] | select(.bucket == "pending")] | length' 2>/dev/null)
  [ -z "$PENDING" ] && echo "API_UNAVAILABLE: gh pr checks returned nothing" && exit 1
  if [ "$PENDING" -eq 0 ]; then
    QUIET=$((QUIET+1))
    [ "$QUIET" -ge 2 ] && echo "QUIET" && exit 0
  else
    QUIET=0
  fi
  sleep 300
done
echo "WINDOW_CLOSED: bots still busy, hand back to the human with the /triage-pr <pr> resume command"
```

## Chaining
`implement-issue` runs this skill itself, as its Stage 5, once the pipeline has opened the
PR — driving the bot comments to zero is part of handing the human a reviewable PR, not an
optional follow-up. It is still invoked directly (`/triage-pr <pr>`) to resume after a
hand-back, to triage a PR the pipeline did not open, and after headless/batch runs, which
have no main thread to hold the loop's human gates.
